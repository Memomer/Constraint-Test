# Constraints
Playing around with LLM's by constraining its intelligence.


# Instructions
- Open agents/itr_one/test_one.py
- Set the Api Key
- Put your own `CORE_RULE` and run the file
- `CORE_RULES` are simple rules that agents follow to communicate with each other, the aim is to give them the most simplest ways to interact like 1 letter, 2 letter, random symbols etc and observe
the emergent behaviour.
- Add a file rules.json/.yaml to store the rules and following observation

# Future Updates
- Better Observability by enhancing autogen.agentchat modules like ConservableAgent, ChatGroup etc.
- Automated rule call, research and insight derivation.
- Web-ui completion
